I am currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) advised by [Dr. Paul Swoboda](http://paulswoboda.net/). Recently, I am interested in incorporating inductive bias into deep networks by embedding algorithms as differentiable layers. This can help in two ways. Firstly a deep learning pipeline can be made more expressive for a given task. Secondly it can also help in guiding algorithms in better decision making by learning through data. I am also interested in developing efficient and scalable algorithms for discrete optimization e.g., by leveraging GPUs.

On the applied side I have around 5 years of experience in visual computing where I have successfully lead projects for 3D reconstruction, calibration for surgical robots and geophysical image analysis. I had the pleasure of being involved in devising product roadmaps, knowledge transfer and in recruitment of new employees. I have also published research while working in industry as my own initiatives.  

I am looking for positions in my interest areas from fall 2023.
